# Executive Sales Dashboard (Power BI)

## Project Overview
Self-service Power BI dashboard demonstrating executive KPI tracking, trend analysis, and product performance insights.

## Business Context
Built to help leaders quickly answer:
- Are we growing year over year?
- What categories/products drive profit vs. losses?
- Which regions are over- or under-performing?
- The dashboard is intentionally restrained to avoid over-interpreting short-term fluctuations.

## Dataset
- Source: Superstore Sales dataset (public sample)
- Grain: Line-item transactions (Order ID repeats across products)
- Key dimensions: Product, Category, Region, Customer
- Primary business date: Order Date

## Technical Skills Demonstrated
- **Power BI**: Executive dashboards, drill-through navigation, slicers, tooltip page
- **DAX**: Time intelligence, YoY growth, defensive measures
- **Data Modeling**: Date table, relationships, measures governance
- **UX / BI Design**: Executive-first layout, restrained conditional formatting

## Key Features
